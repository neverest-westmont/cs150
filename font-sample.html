   <h1>Nancy's Font Sample Webpage (Merriweather)</h1>
   <p class="para1">Fonts are pretty cool, though it can be a lot of work to apply the right ones to the right sections. It was easier to figure out than containers, though. You can link fonts to a page in different ways so it can get confusing. I like graphic design and could play around with different fonts for hours. (Work Sans)</p>
   <p class="para2">This is a font that I liked because it is light and narrow. (Roboto Flex in ExtraLight 200).</p>
